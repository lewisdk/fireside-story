    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
    ...And everyone in the LC101 class was trapped in the 
    Post 137 American Legion building...
    Suddenly, the lights flashed and then everything went 
    dark. All anyone could hear was the wind howling like 
    a mythical banshees of Ireland outside... 
    Aleesha began screaming, "I'm just a programmar; I am not 
    prepared for this." Several of the students tried to calm 
    her down but just then, the doors to the Legion building 
    burst open...
